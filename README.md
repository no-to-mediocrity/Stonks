## Project features
### Custom Jetpack Compose components for UI.
Stonks embraces the power of Jetpack Compose, utilizing its dynamic UI toolkit for a modern and seamless user experience. While parts of the app leverage traditional XML-based UI, strategic screens integrate Compose to take advantage of its declarative approach, enabling efficient UI updates and intuitive design. This hybrid approach allows us to blend the familiarity of existing components with the innovation of Compose, resulting in a harmonious and visually appealing user interface.

### MVVM Architecture 
Stonks takes advantage of the MVVM architecture in targeted segments, revolutionizing the way data flows through the application. Through this model, the app's logic is elegantly decoupled from its UI, promoting easier maintenance and testing. By creating a clear separation between data representation and user interaction, the MVVM approach enhances code reusability and scalability. 

### RoomDB for storage
Stonks integrates Room Database to store vital data subsets. This seamless adoption streamlines local storage with efficient SQLite support, enhancing data consistency and security. The result is a reliable and responsive user experience.
